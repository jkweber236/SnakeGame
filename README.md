# Overview

As a way to expand my knowledge and skills in C++, I developed a classic Snake game to deepen my understanding of the language's syntax and explore game development concepts. This project serves as a practical exercise to apply C++ concepts in a real-world scenario and improve my problem-solving abilities. It's primary purpose is to enhance my understanding of C++ and its features, including handling user input, utilizing arrays, functions, and variables, and controlling game logic. 

This application is my personal rendition of the famous Snake game. It is a console-based application where players control a snake to collect food and grow in length. The game features user input for directional control, a scoring system, and a dynamic grid-based environment. This project aims to demonstrate my proficiency in C++ programming while creating an enjoyable and interactive application.

This demonstration video showcases the Snake game in action, providing a walkthrough of the code and highlighting key aspects of the C++ language syntax.

# Future Work
* I hope to create a two-play version of the game where one person uses WASD and another uses arrow keys. The goal of the game would be to gain the highest score by collecting fruit and outliving the other player.
* Another thing I hope to do with this program is to have the high score save to a file. Currently, once you choose to exit the program, the high score is erased. I would like to make it so that the high score can be saved to a file and then retrieved once the user starts up the program, displaying the all-time high score rather than just the score from a single game session.
* Lasty, I would like to explore graphical enhancements and user interface improvements to make the game more visually appealing.
